# RunCPM

RunCPM is a windows 32 bits application which allows you to execute old CP/M 8 bits programs on Windows.
If you miss powerful programs like Wordstar, dBaseII, Mbasic and others, then RunCPM is for you.

## Getting Started

Just drop the RunCPM executable on a folder and create subfolders on that one called "A", "B", "C" ... these will be you "disk drives".
There's no need to create clumsy disk images. Just put your CP/M programs and files inside these subfolders, which are seen as drive letters "A:", "B:", until "P:".

RunCPM needs a binary copy of the CP/M CCP to be on the same folder as RunCPM.exe. The one provided is CPM22.bin, which is CPM 2.2. Others may work as well, your mileage may vary.
